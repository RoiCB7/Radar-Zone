As it stands, in order to run the game, you will need an Atari Steem Emulator that can run and process Assembly 68k and C. 
Ensure all files are in the same directory. 

In Steem make sure to run the makefile first.
In order to do this; 
1. Type in 'make' without quotations at the prompt.
2. To run the game, type in 'main' without quotations.
